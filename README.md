# machine-learning-challenge
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
An Exoplanet (Extrasolar planet) is a planet that exists outside our solar system. Many exoplanets have been discovered over the years by Nasa’s Kepler telescope. 
If we study and watch these stars over time there may be a regular dimming of their flux (The light intensity). That’s enough evidence to say that there is an orbiting body near the star. Further studies of the candidate system capture light at a different wavelength, could solidify the belief or confirm the existence of these orbiting bodies.

created machine learning model capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset(the Kepler Objects of Interest table).
