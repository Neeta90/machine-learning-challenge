Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
An Exoplanet (Extrasolar planet) is a planet that exists outside our solar system. Many exoplanets have been discovered over the years by Nasaâ€™s Kepler telescope. 

created machine learning model capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.
